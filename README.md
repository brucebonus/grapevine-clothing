## Reflection
Creating this website was very enjoyable because Grapevine is my own clothing market, this process showed me a lot of coding paths I can take to make my website presentable.
I followed the coding style that I mentioned in my report from HTML, CSS and Javascript and tried to keep the styles I was going for in my low/high fidelity mock ups. As I was the only person working on this website, branching was very simple. 
Simply adding commits and pushing it to master branch straight away. Firstly I created the landing page for the website, making sure it is responsive. I didnt want the website to look squashed when viewport decreases so I made the items move down to a different column below each other. Once the landing page was created, I moved on creating other pages keeping the responsive style and essentials such as logo, navigation bar, and footer. When creating viewing modal images was quite simple making a pop up for the products, creating a exit path and clicking outside the box to close works however I still have not figured out how to make it so every modal button works on one Javascript script. Every first modal button works on each page however some does not work as the Javascript is only listening to the first button of each page. Also another improvement I need to make is creating a working payment method for the checkout page, as of right now you can add items, change quantity, remove items and computes the price total. Learning this Javascript took a while to understand. Moreover more content and more coding features need to be added to the website to make it more presentable and engaging.
